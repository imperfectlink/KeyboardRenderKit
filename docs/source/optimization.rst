Optimizing your render.
====
Besides overall scene complexity, there are a few manjor factors that affect your render time and quality.

Resolution
----
Image resolution plays a large part in the amount of time it takes to render an image. Havijg too low a resolution will manifest as a "pixelated" image. Diagonal lines will appear jagged and fine detail may lack the desired definition.

If for example you increase the fidelity of your image by doubling the resolution from 2k to 4k by setting the percent slider to 200%, your computer now has to process four times the number of pixels. This can lead to much crisper images at the cost of much greater render times.

Render Samples
----
The number of samples used is also a key point in optimizing your render. Having too few samples will manifest as a noisy image. Like image resolution, increasing the samples will improve visual fidelity but also increase the render times exponentially.

Denoising
----
For as long as digital imaging has existed, so has the need for noise reduction. Whether the source image has been a digital photograph, a scan or entirely computer generated, the methods still apply.
