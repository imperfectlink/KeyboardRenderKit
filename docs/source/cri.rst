Collection Restore Instance
====

Collection Restore Instance is a simple addon developed to fill a gap in Blender functionality where collection assets do not restore properly with Blender's default "Make Instances Real" function. Blender does not maintain the original collection heirarchy even though parent heirarchy can be maintained.

|

Although Collection Restore Instance was originally developed as a part of Keyboard Render Kit, we quickly realized that this would be useful as a general purpose tool.

|

To use the tool, simply press ctrl+A and find it in the apply menu.
