Add Switches & Stabilizers
====

Occasionally you may want to have visible switches and stabilizers in your render. This may be because you are rendering at a low angle or have transparent keycaps or simply may want to turn the keycaps off altogther to show off the board.

Start by opening up the collection that the keyboard is in and duplicate (linked) the keycap collection. These are going to become our switches.
