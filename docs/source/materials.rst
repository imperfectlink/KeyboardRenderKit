Settings
----
Cap
^^^^
This is the base color of the keycap.

Legend
^^^^
This is the legend color. You can choose a color, plug in a palette to control the color or even plug an image into the socket for full color legends.

LegendMask
^^^^
A white on black image is plugged into this socket to mix between the cap color and the legend color.

Sharpen Legend
^^^^

.. image:: img/SharpenLegend.gif

This is used to sharpen the edge of the legend to appear as a doubleshot legend would. This is set to full by default but you can slide it to zero to simulate more of a dye sublimated look.

Legend Weight
^^^^

Due to the way the legend sharpening works, you may also wish to offset the weight to bolden the legend.

Masks
----
A mask is a white on black image that defines how to mix two colors or elements together. Consider white to be ON and black to be OFF. In the capsmat, masks are used to mix the cap with the legend, the cap with the sublegend and the cap with the front legend. If any of these are not present, it will assume black or off for that portion. KRK comes with templates to make generating these masks simpler.
