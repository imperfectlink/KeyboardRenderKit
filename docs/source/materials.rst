Masks
----
A mask is a white on black image that defines how to mix two colors or elements together. In the capsmat, masks are used to mix the cap with the legend, the cap with the sublegend and the cap with the front legend. If any of these are not present, it will assume black or off for that portion. KRK comes with templates to make generating these masks simpler.
