Welcome to Keyboard Render Kit documentation!
===================================

**KRK** is a Blender kit designed to help visualize keyboard designs and keycap colorways.

KRK2 builds on the object data swapping workflow of KRK1 while making everything more flexible, independent and granular. Keycap profiles no longer depend on the geometry of another, boards are portable and everything can be updated independently from one version to another.

Requirement
----
Blender 3.1 or newer
