Creating Legends

Inkscape

The legend files are created in Inkscape which can be downloaded for free here:

`Inkscape <www.inscape.org>`_

In the future, each profile will have its own template. KRK1 had one file for all profiles but the newly modeled keycaps have a different UV space so they are now broken out into their own templates as well.

Upon opening the svg file you will see a layers panel on the right side that contains the legends as well as the templates for the tops and fronts of the keycaps. If the layers panel isn't visible, you can bring it up by clicking
