Creating Legends

Inkscape
~~~~
The legend files are created in Inkscape which can be downloaded for free here: `Inkscape <www.inscape.org>`_

In the future, each profile will have its own template. KRK1 had one file for all profiles but the newly modeled keycaps have a different UV space so they are now broken out into their own templates as well.
