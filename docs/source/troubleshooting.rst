How do I install Keyboard Render Kit?


Keyboard Render Kit is all packed into the blend file which you can access by simply opening the file in Blender.

Where are my keycaps?


KRK2 has a new workflow that utilizes placeholders and replaces them with the keycap profile of your choosing via the KRK Panel.

My keycaps have no material on them.

Keycaps models in KRK2 come without a material by default. This is so the keycaps and the capsmat can be updated independently.
