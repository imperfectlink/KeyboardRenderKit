How do I install Keyboard Render Kit?


Keyboard Render Kit is all packed into the blend file which you can access by simply opening the file in Blender.

|
Why is Blender asking me to run a script?


KRK2 has an addon portion of the kit and does so installation free by running a registered script.

|
Where are my keycaps?


KRK2 has a new workflow that utilizes placeholders and replaces them with the keycap profile of your choosing via the KRK Panel.

|
My keycaps have no material on them.

Keycaps models in KRK2 come without a material by default. This is so the keycaps and the capsmat can be updated independently.
