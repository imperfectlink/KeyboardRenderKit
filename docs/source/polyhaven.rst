KRK comes preloaded with various floors and light setups to get you started, but you may wish to try alternative floors and lighting to add more variety. Polyhaven is a great resource for surfaces to render your boards on as well as HDRIs (High Dynamic Range Image) to light your scene. Let's go through the process of loading them in.

In Blender, click on File>Append to initiate the import of the Poly Haven floor. From here, choose the Object subcategory and find the floor which is likely named "Plane".
