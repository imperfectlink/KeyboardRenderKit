Your First Board Render
====
Now that you know the basics, let's render a keyboard. We'll expand on what we learned in the first tutorial.

In a fresh KRK2 file, press A in the viewport to select all and then press the Set button in the Relink section of the KRK panel to set them to Cherry profile.
Drag the Capsmat from the asset browser onto one of the keycaps. Shift click the same keycap to make it the active object and press the Copy button in the Data section of the KRK panel.

Select the placeholders on the 959 Mini and press Set in the Relink section of the KRK panel.

Shift click one of the keycaps and to set it to the active object and click Setup in the Color section.
Now press the Paste button in the Color section. This recalls the colours that were stored from the kit.

Let's setup a scene.

|

Delve into the Scene collection into Lights, turn off the visibility options for KitLightingHigh and turn on SoftBoxStudio.
Turn on FloorWood6 in the Floors collection.

|

In Scene Properties, set the camera to Camera_Board2.

|

Rotate the viewport to an interesting angle and set the active camera to view by clicking View > Align View > Align Active Camera To View.

|

Now render your scene.

|

This completes example workflow tutorial 2.
